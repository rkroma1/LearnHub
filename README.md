Student script for population of database done, pending approval of database design. So not going to work on other things until after we agree on what we are going to do. Basic table created that prints http://159.89.43.10/ the mysql data for student information. 

Recommend looking at the database pdf, we will need to implement admin/student views will probably be annoying.
 At minimum thinking we need
 
 Pages : 
 List of all courses
 List of all students
 Add course page?
 Enroll in course page?
 Add student page?
 Edit pages if we want to populate them with existing information so they can see what they are replacing
 Enter student grades
 
 Queries we will need :
 Will need to query registered courses based on logged in user
 A function to calculate grades
 query all courses
 query all students
 
 CSS 
 
 Lifecycle
    Evolution/Iterative -> worse than waterfall
    Waterfall -> too much documentation for this imo
    Open-source life cycle -> lol
    synchronize-and stablize -> no
    spiral -> no
    agile -> works
    Rapid-prototype -> works
    Code and fix -> probably sufficient for this project lol
